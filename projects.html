            <h1>PC Assembler was my first full project. It was a requirement for the OCR A Level Computer Science course to 
                create a website. PC Assembler went through multiple iterations, as well as planning to make sure the project
                was completed by the strict deadline, which was 4pm on the 21st January 2021. <br> <br>
                The Full write up for the project including design and development can be found <a class = "link" target = "_blank" href="writeup.pdf">here</a>. <br><br>
                PC Assembler was one of 3 ideas I had which had to be approved by the teacher. Other ideas included a static HTML page
                using the Plex API to display media from a server for someone who does not have access to the server. <br><br>
                Pc Assembler was my first project which involved the development of custom API's in Java, as well as, creating a Web
                server for the project. This project can be described as full stack. Both the Front-end HTML, CSS and Javascript, as well as
                the back-end Java, API's and SQL database was programmed and designed by myself. <br><br>
                Due to the environment the project was created in, there is currently no live demo.
